*__Happy New Year!! :D__*

1. The Grove sensors/modules available have been split up into the 6 sets. Please refer to the top of the file for the pin allocation.
The full versions are complete and should be uploadable onto the Arduino after connecting the pins correctly.
2. The `EPD_Shield` folder contains the code to use the components already on the shield.
3. A separate set of programming notes have also been compiled under `Notes.md`
4. The demo codes illustrate the differences between Python and C++ programming.
